## Why

In a nutshell, Just for fun ;)
... but here the long version!

Disk Cleanup (Cleanmgr.exe) is a Microsoft software utility first introduced with Windows 98 and included in all subsequent releases of Windows. It allows users to remove files that are no longer needed or that can be safely deleted.

With Windows 10 Microsoft will be retiring Disk Cleanup tool and replace it with Storage Sense. 

I have never been a fan of Storage sense and a year ago i took a new path and created [Cleanmgr+](https://github.com/mirinsoft/CleanmgrPlus). I saw the 1:1 replica of [Albacore's Managed Disk Cleanup yesterday](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/Comet). It looks exactly like the classic cleanmgr.exe and uses identical technical terms and descriptions and does exactly the same thing that the classic Windows Disk Clean-up utility does.

It's sunday and i was a little bored and thought to show Microsoft how i would have done it. The technology was already there (thanks to Albacore) so it only needed a fresh, modern Windows 10 touch. The result you see now is Burnbytes

Everybody who is interested in this project is welcome to help. I myself will not have much time and neither does albacore at the moment. I could imagine for the roadmap an integration of the community cleaner "winapp2.ini". Just quickly thought.

#### My main goal is a community cleaner like it has never existed before. Albacore has done a great preparatory job but there is still a lot to do. Comment, commit to the C# code and share this post.
